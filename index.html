    <h1>Nomvuzelelo Mofutsanyana</h1>
    <p>I'm Nomvuzelelo Patience Mofutsanyana, a young lady building her career as a web developer.I am 
      based in Free State Bloemfontein, in Botshabelo. 
        I matriculated from Dr Viljoen Combined School and decided to launch a small cookie business to earn some income. 
        While running my business, I applied for various jobs and eventually received a
         call about a 1-year learnership program in web development.</p><br>

<br>
        <p>The learnership included 6 months of theory and 6 months of practical training. 
        The theory phase went smoothly, and I received a stipend that helped me with expenses. For the practical phase,
         I was sent to Botshabelo Digital Hub, where I fell in love with front-end development and web design.
          Learning how to code using various languages was a rewarding and exciting experience.
        
        After the learnership, I decided to continue pursuing web development as my career path.</p><br>

        <p>My ultimate goal is to continue learning and mastering my craft in order to establish
         my own web development company. The entrepreneurial spirit that led me to start my cookie
          business is still strong, and I believe that with hard work and dedication, I can make my dream a reality.<br>
        
        As I progress in my career, I plan to further my education in web development, 
        potentially enrolling in a tertiary institution or completing additional certifications.</p><br>
        <br>
        
        <p>In addition to my professional aspirations, I also have a passion for nails and beauty.
         I believe that these interests complement each other, as they both involve creativity and attention to detail.</p> <br>

         and experiences that will shape my career as a web developer and entrepreneur.<br>
